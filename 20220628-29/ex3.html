    <span id="frist" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. Alongside <span>HTML</span> and<span>CSS</span>, 
    <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to makewebpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and allmodern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in 
    <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine. Each of themany 
    <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engines represent a different implementation of 
    <span class="js">JavaScript</span>, all based on the ECMAScript
    specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features
    beyond ECMA.
